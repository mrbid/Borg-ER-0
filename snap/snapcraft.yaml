summary: Draw oscillators and envelopes.
description: |
  This is a very simple tone generator that allows users to draw an oscillator wave-shape and envelope, the oscillator can then be tuned by frequency and amplitude.

  It's a pretty interesting toy and it can generate some interesting tones. It has it's limitations, but I found it eye opening what the contrast of limitations was in comparison to a tone generator with frequency modulation and other forms of synthesis.
