This is a very simple tone generator that allows users to draw an oscillator wave-shape and envelope, the oscillator can then be tuned by frequency and amplitude.

It can generate some interesting tones. It is interesting to see the contrast of limitations in comparison to a tone generator with frequency modulation and other forms of synthesis.

On Windows exported files save to the local directory that the program was executed in, on Linux exported files save to: `~/EXPORTS/Borg_ER-0/`
